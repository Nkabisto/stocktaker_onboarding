      <h1>DIAL A STOCKTAKER – IMPORTANT INFORMATION</h1>
      <h2>PLEASE READ THIS!</h2>

      <p><strong>Please note:</strong> All replies will only be attended to after <em>6 January 2026</em>.</p>

      <p>Your application is just the first step. Make sure you are prepared for the next stages!</p>

      <p><strong>Dial a Stocktaker</strong> is a division of Dial a Student, established in 1988. We offer students and school leavers the opportunity to gain valuable work experience while earning money. But we need to ensure that all applicants are fully committed to the process.</p>

      <h3>Please Understand the Process We Need You to Go Through:</h3>

      <h4>This is an Application:</h4>
      <p>By submitting your application, you are expressing interest in working with us. If your application is successful, you will be invited to come through for Registration.</p>

      <h4>Registration (Not Training):</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Registration will require you to come to our office in Braamfontein. This is NOT the training session!</li>
        <li>During registration, you will be able to ask any other questions you may have.</li>
        <li>You will pay for your training materials and confirm a suitable date for your Training.</li>
        <li>Once you have successfully registered, you will receive materials that you must study before the training date.</li>
        <li><strong>DO NOT BE LATE</strong> for your training session.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Training:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The training session is designed to apply what you have learned from the materials you studied.</li>
        <li>You will be tested on theoretical knowledge.</li>
        <li>If you pass the theoretical test, you will then do practical training and be tested again.</li>
        <li>Only after passing both tests can you start applying to work for stocktakes.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What Are the Requirements?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Must be a South African citizen</li>
        <li>Must be at least 18 years old</li>
        <li>Must have passed Grade 11 successfully</li>
        <li>Must be able to read and write</li>
        <li>Must have basic mathematical knowledge</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Key Things You Must Know:</h3>

      <h4>This Is Not a Simple Job Application:</h4>
      <p>After submitting your application, there are mandatory steps that you must complete to become a part of our team. You must attend an in-person registration or telephone interview—this is a non-negotiable part of the process.</p>

      <h4>Why Your Availability Matters:</h4>
      <p>Stocktaking usually takes place on weekends or after hours. Make sure you can commit to this schedule. If you are unable to attend the registration or training, you will not be considered for the stocktaking jobs.</p>

      <h4>Ensure You Can Be Reached:</h4>
      <p>Your email address is critical! If the email address you provide is incorrect, you will miss out on all further communication and job opportunities. Check your email regularly and respond promptly when we reach out to you.</p>

      <h4>Our Legitimacy:</h4>
      <p>We understand the importance of trust, especially with the rise of scams in the recruitment industry. To verify that we are a legitimate and trusted business, you can check out our official Facebook page: <a href="#">Dial A Stocktaker Facebook Page</a>.</p>
      <p>Additionally, our company has been operating successfully since 1988, and we are proud to have helped thousands of students and school leavers gain valuable work experience.</p>

      <h3>Why You Need to Complete the Full Process:</h3>

      <h4>Training is Essential:</h4>
      <p>The training you will receive is designed to ensure you are fully prepared for stocktaking assignments. Without completing the training, you cannot be considered for jobs. The training fee is a small investment compared to the earning potential from your first stocktake assignment (you’ll earn more than double the training fee on your first job).</p>

      <h4>Commitment is Key:</h4>
      <p>By signing up, you’re committing to be part of a reliable team. We need people who are serious and able to follow through with the steps. If you do not attend registration or training, we cannot place you on stocktakes.</p>

      <h3>What Happens After You Submit Your Application:</h3>

      <h4>Office Closure Notice:</h4>
      <p>Please note that our offices are closed from now until 6 January. As a result, all applications will only be reviewed after this date. Response times may be delayed, so please be patient, and we will get back to you as soon as possible.</p>

      <p>Within one week after our reopening, you will receive an email confirming the status of your application.</p>

      <p>If you are selected, you will be invited for a telephone interview or scheduled to come to our office for the registration process.</p>

      <h4>If You Do Not Attend the Registration:</h4>
      <p>If you do not show up for the registration or fail to complete your training, we will not be able to offer you work.</p>

      <h4>Training Session:</h4>
      <p>You must bring the required documents (ID, academic records, training fee) to the registration. The training session is mandatory, and you will not be registered as a member until you complete it successfully.</p>

      <h3>Critical Reminders:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Training Fee (R80):</strong> Bring the fee to your registration session. Once you pass the training, you will more than double that amount on your first job.</li>
        <li><strong>Transport Costs:</strong> You will need to arrange transport to our Braamfontein offices twice—once for your registration and again when you come for your training session. Please account for this transport money in your budget as it is necessary to complete the process.</li>
        <li><strong>No Show = No Work:</strong> If you do not attend the registration, you will not be considered for stocktaking assignments. Failure to follow through will prevent you from earning money.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>To Avoid Wasting Your Time and Ours:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Before submitting your application, double-check that you have a working email address.</li>
        <li>If you cannot commit to the training and availability requirements, please do not apply.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Don’t Miss Out on This Opportunity!</h3>
      <p>By completing your registration and training, you gain access to numerous stocktaking opportunities across the country. The work is flexible and well-paid—once you are registered, you are in control of when and where you work!</p>
      <p><strong>Final Thought:</strong> We understand life can be busy, but failing to complete the process means missing out on earning opportunities. Make sure you are ready to follow through before you apply!</p>
